# Polar Ocean
Python code showcasing the preprocessing, regridding and processing of several datasets from NASA, NOAA, and the UK Center for Polar Observations and Modeling. Two versions of the code are provided:

`processDatasetSimple.py` is a basic version of the code that access the required input files remotely.

`processDatasetFull.py` is the operational version of the code. It requires the input files to be already present locally.

Usage instructions can be obtained by running

`./processDatasetSimple.py`

or

`./ProcessDatasetFill.py`

without any argument.
